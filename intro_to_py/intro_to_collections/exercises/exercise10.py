#Bob expects the following code to print the names in alphabetical
#order. Without running the code, can you say whether it will?
#Explain your answer

names = {'Chris', 'Clare', 'Karis', 'Karl',
         'Max', 'Nick', 'Victor'}


#It will not reliably print the names in alphabetical order because the set is an unordered collection
# and therefore no well defined order exists
